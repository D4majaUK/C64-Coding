Soooooo! I have been experimenting with the good old 64, and I have managed to get rid of the top and bottom borders.
Then created some sprites and animated them in the borders. I also created a snippet of SID music (only a beginner, so have mercy).
There is a pinch of interrupts and raster line manipulation just to add the icing to the cake.
